Emm...I'm very glad, with my partner, we made an another game.
I have to say, we made much progress than our first game!
Although it's very poor after we finishing it and reconsidering it again,it still much better!
It have more beautiful images, musics...
Well, we also used EGE to help us building this game, whatever we also learned a lot during making this progarmm.
Hoping we can write better things!
